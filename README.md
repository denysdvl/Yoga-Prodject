### It's a web site about traveling to India <h2>
        
This site is written in pure JavaScript and CSS, 
this project used **AJAX, promise, ES-6, etc...** Interesting 
solutions were also used. Descriptions of all classes 
can be found at my repositories, also used compilation 
of JavaScript modules via **webpack**

Evaluate the design you can watch the demo.
